梅·克雷格是美国最早的女性记者之一，因报导二战、朝鲜战争与美国政治而著称。她是美国妇女选举权协会（1890年2月18日成立）成员，也是儿童平等受教育权的倡导者。

Although May Craig was a Southerner, she got her break in journalism working for the Maine-based Guy Gannett chain of newspapers(including the Portland Press Herald). She became the company's Washington correspondent, and wrote her *Inside Washington* column for almost fifty years. She took on leadership roles within both the **Women's National Press Club** and Eleanor Roosevelt's **Press Conference Association**, both organisations supporting women in journalism.
尽管梅·克雷格是南方人，她在缅因州的甘尼特报系（包括波特兰先锋报）记者工作取得了突破。她成为公司的华盛顿通讯员，并且为*华盛顿内*专栏撰稿近50年。她还在妇女记者俱乐部和安娜·埃莉诺·罗斯福（美国第32任总统富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福的妻子）的新闻协会担任领导职位，这两个组织都支持女性在新闻行业的工作。


 May Craig married Donald A. Craig. Mrs. Craig leaves a daughter, Mrs. Betty Clagett of Wheaton, Md.; a son, Donald A. Craig of Bethesda, Md.

Mrs. Craig also won other firsts for women. She was said to have been the first woman reporter to fly the Berlin airlift, the first woman reporter to cover the Korean truce talks and the first woman to fly over the North Pole. 克雷格为女性赢得多个第一，她是第一个柏林供给线上的女性报道员，第一个朝鲜停战协议的女性报道员，并且是第一个飞越北极的女性。

- 例子：During the Second World War, Craig secured a succession of postings to Europe. From this vantage point, she gave eyewitness accounts of the V-bomb attacks on London, the Battle of Normandy and the liberation of Paris. During the war, she constantly battled with the male military commanders and male journalists to have access to the news. One of her best-known quotations is a reference to facilities, the lack of which was often given as reason for not allowing Craig to follow up on the news. She joked that,  「Bloody Mary of England once said that when she died they would find Calais graven on her heart" (in reference to a key French outpost lost during Mary's reign); 」When I die, there will be the word facilities, so often it has been used to prevent me from doing what men reporters could do."
二战时期，克雷格获得了对欧洲的系列报道。基于这个有利点，她目击并报道了对伦敦的伏击炸弹袭击，诺曼底战役和巴黎解放。 在战争中，她不断与男军官和男记者进行战斗，以获得新闻。 她最著名的引言就是对「才能」的引用，缺乏「才能」经常被认为不允许克雷格跟进那些新闻的理由。 她开玩笑说，「英国玛丽一世曾经说过，当她死时，人们会发现加来埋在她心房（参考玛丽在位时法国要塞的失守）。当我死了，将会有词语才能，一直被用来阻止我做男记者可以做的事情。」
